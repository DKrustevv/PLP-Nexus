# Watch Catalog Web Application

## Summary

This project involves the creation of a responsive watch catalog web application using React.js and Material-UI. The application allows users to explore and filter a collection of watches based on attributes like gender, strap type, price range, and minimum rating. Sorting functionality has also been implemented, enabling users to arrange watches alphabetically and by price. The project was completed using React components and Material-UI styles to ensure a visually pleasing and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** The project utilizes React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Functional components and hooks were employed to manage state and interactivity effectively.

- **Material-UI:** Material-UI components were customized to create a cohesive design throughout the application, offering pre-designed components, styles, and themes.

## Features Implemented

1. **Navbar and Filter Menu:** A responsive navigation bar was developed with a menu icon, logo, and shopping cart icon. The left-side filter menu empowers users to select specific filtering criteria.

2. **Sorting Functionality:** The sorting menu allows users to arrange displayed watches by alphabetical order (A-Z and Z-A) and price (ascending and descending).

3. **Watch Display and Load More:** Watches are presented in a grid layout, and users can load additional watches by scrolling down. Each watch card includes an image, name, description, price, ratings, and an "Add to Cart" button.

4. **Feedback Alerts:** When a watch is added to the cart, a feedback alert appears, confirming the addition.

## Implementation Details

The project was built using React.js, adopting functional components and hooks for state management. Material-UI components were customized to ensure a visually pleasing and responsive design. FilterMenu and SortMenu components were created to enable straightforward filtering and sorting. Prop validation was implemented to guarantee proper data flow and code quality.

## Challenges and Reflections

Throughout the implementation, no major challenges were encountered. However, due to family-related matters, I faced time constraints during the past week, which affected the scope of feature implementation. Despite this, I am confident that the delivered features provide a solid foundation and adhere to the project requirements.
